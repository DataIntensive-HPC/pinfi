HOW TO USE PINFI:

- In the command line, type 'make' under the root folder of the pinfi project to compile the pinfi.
- After compiling pinfi, a folder called obj-intel64 will be created under the project folder.
- Make sure pin is installed.
- We provide a fault injection script located in example/ , namely faultinject.py. There are several variables in the script need to be set based on your own configurations:
  - progbin: folder path to the benchmark under test
  - pinbin: path to the executable of pin
  - instcategorylib: path to instcategory.so which can be found under obj-intel64 folder.
  - instcountlib: path to instcount.so which can be found under obj-intel64 folder.
  - filib: path to faultinjection.so which can be found under obj-intel64 folder.
  - outputdir: std output generated by the benchmark under test.
  - errordir: error output generated by the benchmark under test.
  - basedir: golden output generated by the benchmark under test.

- Put the instructions that are desired to be fault injected in pin.instcategory.txt under the directory where faultinject.py locates, we provide an example in example/ as well.
